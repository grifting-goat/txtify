convert scanned pdfs to formatted text(using tesseract and gemini)

to use make a .env file with the content "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY" but your key is your key.
adjust the prompt to your specific application.
put the PDFs you wish to convert in the same directory as the script.
you will need tesseract installed for the script to work.
much room for improvement but it gets the job done.
